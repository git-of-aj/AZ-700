---------------
## check 
- floating IP azure load balancer
- xml file needs to be installed on clinet machine for P2S vpn ... we do it via intune
- If you have enabled service endpoints to PaaS service in your subnet, and you have Azure FW, does it bypass the FW?
- network monitoring tool - cacti, Auvik
- connectivity to Zscaler via vWAN is a bad idea, as it only create tunnel to a single Zscaler PoP.. no redundancy
- But in real life, Region is same then VM's from peered vnet-2 can be added but in a New backend where you add via IP not NIC
